* Pause command should pause for 1 day only
* Add commit mode (count commits instead of loc). Allow user to choose 
  commit or loc mode (default is commits)
* ~~History calculation seems broken (way too many commits, loc)~~ - Matt says this is a red herring
* Add some visualization of history?
* ~~Stats/status command should tell the user how many more commits or loc
they need to write.~~ - Already implemented in formatStats()
